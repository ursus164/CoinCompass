# CoinCompass

CoinCompass is a JavaFX-based desktop application designed to provide real-time market data and analytics for cryptocurrencies. The application offers an interface for tracking market trends, prices, and data of various cryptocurrencies.

It's my first "bigger" project that I've made in Java - it is a development-version. Feel free to comment or suggest any improvements - it will be much appreciated!

## Important
In this stage, If you want to launch the app, please do It via, main class found in GUI package. Project is in the test stage. Many features which I created, has not been used, and many of them will need to be written once more in different way. When we start creating app, we usually think that our ideas which we have are brilliant, but after all it turns out that this is not the way:) However, writing such an application gave me a lot of experience, so in the future I will try to create better version of that... Anyways, have fun :)

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CoinCompass.git

2. **Build the Project**:
   Navigate to the project directory in your IDE, then find GUI package and class "Main". Simply click "build" button.

## Usage
In this version app is using free CoinGecko Api key. So there is the query limit for the server. If you have your own API key and want to use it, you will have to individually change that in classes responsible for fetching market data and charts. In the future update, I will add option to simply type in private key, and all the neccessary changes in the source code will be done automatically.
