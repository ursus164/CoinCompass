# CoinCompass

CoinCompass is a JavaFX-based desktop application designed to provide real-time market data and analytics for cryptocurrencies. The application offers an interface for tracking market trends, prices, and data of various cryptocurrencies.

It's my first "bigger" project that I've made in Java. So feel free to comment or suggest any improvements - it will be much appreciated!

## Important
In this stage, If you want to launch te app, please do It via, main class found in GUI package. I have not packed project into .jar file.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CoinCompass.git

2. **Build the Project**:
   Navigate to the project directory in your IDE, then find GUI package and class "Main". Simply click "build" button.

   ## Usage
In this version app is using free CoinGecko Api key. So there is the query limit for the server. If you have your own API key and want to use it, you will have to individually  change that in API class responsible for fetching data.
